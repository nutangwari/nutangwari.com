## Problem

Type coercion has always been a perplexing topic in JavaScript. It's straightforward to grasp when dealing with primitive values like numbers and strings. However, the challenge arises when we delve into complex datatypes such as arrays, sets, and dates. Understanding how it operates becomes considerably more intricate in such cases. Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this:

```ts
const a = '6' + 2;
// a is '62'
```

Predicting the operation is fairly straightforward; in this case `2` will be converted to a string, followed by string concatenation.
Pretty simple, right? Now, let's explore the outcome when we perform `subtraction(-)` operations on similar types::

```ts
const b = '6' - 2
// b is 4
```

Now the answer would be the numeric `4`, which is a bit peculiar.

Alright, let's temporarily assume that we can anticipate this outcome. Since strings can't be subtracted `'6'`  is consequently converted to the numeric `6` and the numeric operation is executed. But what if we begin utilizing other datatypes like arrays, sets, or objects? let's take an simple example:

```ts
const m = [] + [] ;
// value of m:  ""
```

We observe that the output is an empty string, which is rather peculiar, isn't it? Now, what if we attempt a subtraction operation on the same issue?:

```ts
const n = [] - [];
// n is 0
```

Somewhat unpredictable, isn't it?
To me, this unpredictability constitutes the real challenge. We shouldn't merely cram up these logics; instead, what we truly need is a logical flow or algorithm that enables us to consistently arrive at the correct answers.

On the same note, throughout this exploration, we've observed that Type Coercion exhibits somewhat peculiar behavior. However, one significant pattern has emerged: whenever the `'-'` (subtraction) operator is used, the return type is a number, whereas in the case of `'+'` we obtain a string. Although this isn't an absolute truth, let's, for the time being, develop an algorithm based on this information we have gathered so far.

<br />

Certainly, let's outline the behaviors so that we can construct our type coercion algorithm:

1. `subtraction` between any datatypes always returns numeric operation:
    ```ts
        '10' - 5 = 5 //number
    ```

2. `addition (+)` operation on number datatypes always returns number
    ```ts
    2 + 2 = 4 //number
    ```

3. `addition (+)` operation, if, any of the type is string, resultant value is always `string`
    ```ts
    '2'+ 2 + 3 + 1 = '2231' // string
    ```

For Primitive values such as `string` and `number` these patterns will serve as foundational principles for our type coercion algorithm.
Now let's delve into the behaviors of complex datatypes like Object and Array


## Array & Object

Lets revisit our array problem:

```ts
const m = [ ] + [ ] ;
// m: ""
```

Arrays are complex data types; they can encompass numbers, strings, objects, nested arrays, functions, and more. Essentially, arrays can store a diverse range of elements. Consequently, performing mathematical operations on arrays becomes a laborious endeavor. Moreover, in JavaScript, array lengths are dynamic, rendering `addition` or `subtraction` on array is unfeasible.

> <span className="note">Note :</span> JavaScript Objects and consequently Arrays have a couple of useful methods at their disposal. Frequently, we might not employ these methods directly, but JavaScript effectively leverages them extensively internally. These methods are `.toString(){:ts}` and `.valueOf(){:ts}`.


Let's attempt to utilize these methods with the following example:
```ts /.toString()/
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'].toString(); // 'red,green,blue' 
```

The `.toString(){:ts}` method applied to an Array essentially yields the concatenated values of all the array elements:
```ts
const nums = [1, 2, ''].toString(); // '1,2,' as string

const test = [1, 2, {}] + [1] //'1,2,[object Object]1'
// .toString on object returns [object Object]
```

JavaScript Type Coercion employs these methods to streamline addition or subtraction operations on these intricate data types. Let's deconstruct the Array `addition` problem using the knowledge we have gained above; we can rewrite it as follows:

```ts
m = [] + [];
[].toString() + [].toString();
'' + '' = '';
 // hence m = ''
```

This is precisely what occurs internally: type coercion invokes the `.toString(){:js}` method to transform non-primitive values into their corresponding primitive forms. In the case of an addition operation, as we cannot directly add non-primitive values, their string representations are concatenated


> <span className="note">Note :</span> Any operation like subtraction, multiplication, or division—with the exception of addition (+)— always invokes mathematical operations.

Let's take another example:

```ts
const m = [] - [];
// m = 0;
```

**Logically, Is it possible to Mutliply or subtract strings?**

Any mathematical operation except addition would yield a numeric operation. To achieve this, the array needs to be converted into its corresponding primitive value:

> <span className="note">Note :</span> `.toPrimitive(){:ts}` is an internal method that manages the conversion of Arrays or Objects into their corresponding primitive values. This roughly translates to `Number([1]){:js}` for converting number types and .`toString(){:js}` for string types.

```ts
m = [] - [];
m = Number([]) - Number([]);
m = 0 - 0; //0
```


With this understanding, let's add new rules to the algorithm we previously outlined. Up until now, we have established three rules:

<div className="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-neutral-700">
1. `subtraction (-)` between any datatypes always returns numeric operation
2. `addition (+)` operation on number datatypes always returns number
3. `addition (+)` operation, if, any of the type is string, returned value is always `string`

Let's rephrase them in light of our comprehension of the Array/Object examples discussed earlier:

1. Verify if both arguments are primitive values; if not, proceed to `rule#2{:css}`, otherwise, convert them to primitive values:
    - i) For primitive conversion, apply `.toString(){:js}` to all non-primitive arguments.

2. Inspect the operator. If it's a non-addition operator (anything other than `'+'`), then:
    - i) It will always entail a numeric operation. In this case, proceed to `rule#4{:css}`.
    - ii) Alternatively, if either of the arguments is a `string`, it involves string concatenation. Move on to `rule#3{:css}`.
    - iii) If both arguments are non-strings, it signifies mathematical addition. jump to `rule#4{:css}`.

3. Perform a string concatenation operation on both arguments and provide the concatenated string as the result. Exit the algorithm; do not execute `rule#4{:css}`.

4. Numeric operations are straightforward. Apply the `Number(){:js}` function to all arguments.
    - For example, `'2' - '1'{:js}` would be executed as `Number('2') - Number('1'){:js}`.

> If operator is anything other than `'+'`, then it's always numeric operation


### Explanation with Examples:
Lets take a example and try to solve it with above rules:

#### Example #1: Array addition
Let's follow above rules step-by-step to find out the answers:
```ts
 const m = [1] + [2 , 3]
 //output: 12, 3
```

    - `Rule#1`: Both arguments are non-primitive(Array), so lets convert them to primitive by calling `.toString(){:js}` method:

    ```ts
        m = [1].toString() + [2 , 3].toString();
        // m becomes:
        m = '1' + '2, 3';
    ```
    - `Rule#2`: operator is `'+'` and atleast one of the argument is `string`, hence follow `Rule#3`, returning string concatenation:

    ```ts
        m = '1' + '2, 3'
        // string concatenation would result:
        '12,3'
    ```

<br />

#### Example #2: Subtraction

Again, we will follow same set of rules we captured above, this time with subtraction operator:
```ts
    const sub = [90] - [10]
    //sub: 80
```

    - `Rule#1`: Both arguments are non-primitive(Array), so we need to call `.toString(){:js}` on both arguments

    ```ts
        const sub = [90].toString() - [10].toString();
        //sub would become:
        sub = '90' - '10'
    ```

    - `Rule#2`: operator is `'-'`, so it will be always numeric operation, that means we need to jump to `Rule#4`:
    ```ts
        sub = Number('90') - Number('10')
        sub = 90 - 10
        // and hence answer is 80
    ```


> <span className="note">Note :</span> Object contains `.toObject(){:js}` and all the objects in javascript inherits this method. By default `.toString(){:js}` on object returns `[object Object]{:js}` but inheriting object can override this method. For eg: Array returns string representation of all elements in an Array`

#### Example #3: .toString() method of Object

```ts
    const a = {user: 'John'}, b = {age: 25};
    const obj = a + b;
    // results '[object Object][object Object]''
```

    - `Rule#1`: both arguments are objects, hence we need to convert them to primitive values, hence we need to call `.toString(){:js}` on both non-primitive arguments:
    ```ts
        obj = a.toString() + b.toString();
        obj = '[object Object]' + '[object Object]';
    ```

    - `Rule#2`: Operator is `'+'` and atleast one argument is string, hence string concatenation will happen
    ```ts
        obj = '[object Object][object Object]'
    ```


## Equality Comparison: == vs ===

Undoubtedly one of the most asked javascript interview questions, right!

```ts
    '2' == 2    // true
    '2' === 2   // false
```

> <span className="tip">Tip : </span> Double equals `'=='` only compares the value, while `'==='` compares value and type.

**Here's another question: Which one is faster, `'=='` or `'==='`?**

One might assume that `'=='` would be slightly faster, as it only involves comparing the values, whereas `'==='` compares both values and types. However, in reality, it's the opposite. `'==='` would actually be a bit faster. This is because we're bypassing the type coercion mechanism in `'==='`; we explicitly instruct JavaScript to skip coercion and directly compare the arguments.



## Tricks & Tips:

This segment of the blog is the thrilling part. Here, we will harness the knowledge we have acquired and delve into some enjoyable aspects of JavaScript.

### Parsing Numbers using Type Coercion:

There are many ways we could parse numbers:
```ts
    const num = '47';
    parseInt(num)   // 47;
    Number(num)     // 47;
    +num            // 47
```

> <span className="note">Rule #2 :</span> If operator is other than `'+'`, then it's always numeric operation

```ts
    // parsing to number by using any operator other than '+'
    '47' - 0    // 47 
    '47' * 1    // 47
    '47' / 1    // 47
```


### Overriding .toString() method for non-primitives:

```ts
    const radius = 10;
    const pieObject = {
        pieShort: 3.14,
        pieLong: 3.1415926
        toString() {
            return this.pieShort;
        }
    }
    // area of circle = pie * square of radius
    const circleArea = pieObject * (radius * radius);
    // 314
```

{/* Now that we understand how non-primitive values are initially transformed into primitive values through the .toString() method in type coercion, we can utilize this knowledge to redefine the .toString() method and craft robust utilities and scripts to achieve anticipated outcomes. In the aforementioned example, the .toString() method was discovered within the lexical scope of the pieObject, and it was invoked instead of Object.prototype.toString(). */}

Now that we know, in type coercion, non-primitive values are first converted to primitive values by calling `.toString(){:js}` method, we could use this to override the `.toString(){:js}` method to create powerful utilities and scripts so that we get expected results. In above example, `.toString(){:js}` was found in the lexical scope of the `pieObject` and it gets called instead of `Object.prototype.toString{:js}`.


> <span className="warning">Note:</span> Beware of overriding internal methods, this could lead to unexpected results, it's advisable to be aware about the changes you are doing.


## End Notes:


Specifications written for these topics are quite challenging for typical JavaScript developers to comprehend. As a result, I attempted to explain them using JavaScript terminology. However, in doing so, I intentionally omitted a significant amount of detailed information and internal workings in order to maintain simplicity and limit the scope of this topic. Despite these limitations, we managed to address the crucial facets of type coercion. Grasping the fundamentals not only expands our knowledge but also goes beyond the tricks we were ablt to do in the previous section.
